<p>This series of notebooks is designed to introduce you to the foundational concepts and techniques used in data science and artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>As our world becomes increasingly data-driven, the ability to analyze, visualize, and draw insights from large and complex datasets is becoming an essential skill. Data science can provide you with the tools to make better decisions and solve complex problems.</p>

<p>In addition, the rise of artificial intelligence and machine learning is revolutionizing the world. Understanding the principles and applications of AI is important for the future.</p>

<p>This will cover a wide range of topics, from basic data manipulation to advanced machine learning algorithms. We will use Python as our programming language in Jupyter notebooks because that is how data science is usually done in the real world. Python has great code libraries for data science and artificial intelligence, such as pandas, Plotly, and NLTK.</p>

<p>Each notebook will focus on a specific topic, and we will provide plenty of examples and exercises to help you solidify your understanding. Whether you're a complete beginner or have some prior experience, this series will provide you with a solid foundation in data science and artificial intelligence.</p>
