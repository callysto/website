<h2>When and how did “Among Us” become so popular?</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whodunit” board games like </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cluedo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clue</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have long been popular with kids. The same is now proving true with gaming apps. The online multiplayer game </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> which was released in June 2018, is a fun remix of the idea of “finding the imposter in the crowd”.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As </span><a href="https://comicyears.com/gaming/the-history-of-among-us-2020s-surprise-hit/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Taylor Bauer describes</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in the infotainment news site </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Comic Years</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Equal parts </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clue</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and co-op sim game, the history of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is an underdog story about trusting your instinct. There’s always been an audience for this type of game. It just took a lot of us at home, staying indoors, and craving connection to our friends to find it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We wondered if this statement was true: “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">It just took a lot of us at home, staying indoors, and craving connection to our friends to find it.”</span></p>
<p>To answer our question we:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Gathered data from </span><a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/945360#All" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Steamcharts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, which tracks concurrent players in Steam games (one of the largest online gaming platforms).</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Created a line graph that plots the maximum number of simultaneous players on the y-axis, and the date on the x-axis. </span></li>

<h2><b>Reflect on what you see</b></h2>
<p>Look and interact with the line graph above. When you mouse-over the line graph you’ll notice more information appears.</p>
<h4><b>Think about the following questions:</b></h4>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you notice about the line graph?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What do you wonder about the data?</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">What was happening in the world during the peak times </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> was being played?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can we speculate that social isolation caused by COVID-19 may have had an impact on the increase in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Among Us</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> players? Why or why not?&nbsp;</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Can you find other online games that showed peak usage during the same time period?&nbsp;</span>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="2"><span style="font-weight: 400;">How would you find the data for those games?</span></li>
</ul>
