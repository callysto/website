<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So you may have heard about Callysto</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but are not sure where to start?! Well, we are inviting all grade 5-12 teachers in Canada to try out the new all-in-one teaching and learning platform through Callysto’s newly launched </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.callysto.ca/gallery-of-interesting-notebooks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallery of Interesting Notebooks</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">. The Gallery showcases a few examples of Callysto’s curriculum-based learning modules or notebooks and demonstrates just how simple and accessible this technology is. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Callysto uses </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jupyter</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, a university-level analytics platform, as a framework for its online, interactive textbook-like program for younger students.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> The new resource was developed by </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.cybera.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cybera</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and The Pacific Institute for the Mathematical Sciences (</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.pims.math.ca/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">PIMS</span></a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">)</span> to help dedicated and tech-loving teachers transform their lesson plans, and encourage students to think outside the box, or in this case, outside the traditional textbook. The platform is designed to teach digital literacy and computational thinking, which are defining features of our future, and key ingredients to successful career paths for today’s students. The cost-free tool supports learning with beginner-level coding, interactive data analysis and visualizations, digital math equations, external media pairing, and more. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Gallery of Interesting Notebooks provides teachers with a preview of Callysto’s many innovative features. You don’t need to register for an account to try out the Gallery; simply access it from any web enabled device, select your preferred subject, and follow the three simple steps listed at the top of the Gallery page. From there, have fun playing and experimenting with the platform’s versatile and powerful computing capabilities!&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For example, in the Math 7-11 demo notebook, you can use an automatic random number generator to “flip” an infinite number of virtual coins and experiment with probability. The notebook’s interactive widgets allow you to visualize the coin toss experiment from a unique graphic perspective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>In the Science 9 demo notebook, you can collect live, open data from a City of Edmonton water treatment plant’s measurements of water conductivity, chlorine, alkalinity, etc. You can then plot that data in a graph, along with your own experimental data, to compare and analyze the quality of the water samples.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>And in the Language Arts demo notebook, you can find and import famous works of literature, such as Macbeth and Hamlet, and run automated analysis to determine their most used words and phrases. You can then plot those results, to give you a unique visual perspective and understanding of these works.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br>You should find the demo notebooks easy to navigate. Callysto was designed so any teacher, regardless of their technological background, can use the tool to enhance the digital learning experience in his or her classroom, without the need to know how to code. Notebooks are available in a wide variety of curriculum-based subjects. If you wish to further explore other notebooks, you just need to <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://hub.callysto.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">set up a free account</a></span> on the Callysto platform. </span></p>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The easiest way to learn how to use Callysto in your classroom is to sign up for a free teacher training workshop. We will be scheduling a number of workshops throughout the summer and into the fall, and will be updating our </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.callysto.ca/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">events page</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> as we add more workshops. If you do not find a suitable location there</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, please </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.callysto.ca/contact/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">contact us</a></span><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to schedule a workshop in your area or <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.callysto.ca/events/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">request a group training session</a></span>. The Callysto team is also continually seeking teacher input on existing notebooks, as well as suggestions for new notebooks. If you have an idea for a specific lesson plan, please contact us. We would love to hear from you!</span></p>
