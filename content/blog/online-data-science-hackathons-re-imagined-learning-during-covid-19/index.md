h2><span style="color: #993366;">How the re-imagining began</span></h2>
<p>The COVID-19 pandemic caused a seemingly overnight shift to online learning for many students and teachers across Canada. We also experienced this shift at Callysto.</p>
<p>For us, this shift meant pivoting in-person data science hackathons (geared towards Grades 9-12 students) to an online format. In our data science hackathons, students solve a problem by “hacking” or analyzing open, freely available data.</p>
<p>Running online hackathons helped us learn how to structure our content for remote learning. We also wanted to provide a free, virtual learning experience that would support teachers and students with developing data science skills – coding, data analysis, and computational thinking.</p>
<p>If you’re a Grades 9-12 teacher interested in teaching data science using online hackathons, this post will go over:</p>
<ul>
<li>How online data science hackathons can be beneficial for students.</li>
<li>How we re-imagined our hackathons for online learning using instructional design and constructive alignment (Callysto’s online data science hackathon,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callysto.ca/2020/09/10/students-seek-a-sustainable-life-on-mars-as-part-of-callysto-hackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sustaining Mars</a>, is used as an example).</li>

</ul>
<h2><span style="color: #993366;">Some background</span></h2>
<h3>How are data science hackathons&nbsp;beneficial for students?</h3>
<p>In our experience, students benefit from data science hackathons in the following ways:</p>
<h5><strong>They practice curriculum-based skills</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>Mathematics classes throughout&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cicic.ca/1240/an_overview_of_elementary_and_secondary_education.canada">Grades 9-12</a>&nbsp;explore problem solving methodologies. Hackathons allow students to practice these skills by analyzing datasets, and creating math-based conclusions.</li>
</ul>
<h5><strong>They develop data literacy skills</strong></h5>
<ul>
<li>“Literacy” refers to the ability to communicate meaning (descriptions of how we perceive or think). Students in hackathons learn how to find, interpret, and visualize data to communicate their understanding of a given topic.</li>
</ul>
<h5>They learn workforce skills</h5>
<ul>
<li>Python programming, which is used in the hackathon platform, is also a popular programming language used widely in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/best-programming-languages-to-learn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">workforce</a>.</li>
<li>Students also develop the ability to work in teams to find a solution, including coordinating roles, building a workplan, and setting targets to work towards.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Hackathon example: Sustaining Mars</h3>
<p>Callysto ran our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.callysto.ca/2020/09/10/students-seek-a-sustainable-life-on-mars-as-part-of-callysto-hackathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sustaining Mars</a>&nbsp;hackathon from August 5-10, 2020. For this challenge, Grades 9-12 students were asked to determine how to make Mars habitable for humans.</p>
<p>The hackathon featured two tracks:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Curiosity (beginner):</strong>&nbsp;In step-by-step Python programming exercises, students analyzed an open dataset about pets to determine which animals to take to Mars.</li>
<li><strong>Amal (advanced):</strong>&nbsp;Students chose their own question to answer about sustaining life on Mars. They also had to find their own open data set to analyze and support their conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p>*Curiosity was named after NASA’s 2011 Mars rover; “Amal” was named after the United Arab Emirates Space Agency’s recent mission to the red planet.</p>
<h3>What is instructional design?</h3>
<p>Instructional design is a methodology for&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/c9b0ce_4c5d961291de41e58e08576d3c9ee868.pdf">developing educational content to fit the learner’s needs and goals</a>.&nbsp;This includes developing and testing new learning materials or activities. The goal is to help the student and acquire and apply a specific set of knowledge and skills.</p>
<h3>What is constructive alignment?</h3>
<p>Constructive alignment involves&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tru.ca/__shared/assets/Constructive_Alignment36087.pdf">designing learning outcomes before teaching begins</a>. It is a system of working backwards: figuring out what you want the students to learn, and then developing classroom activities and assessments that align with those outcomes.</p>
<h2><span style="color: #993366;">Re-imagining our Sustaining Mars hackathon for online learning</span></h2>
<h3>Instructional design</h3>
<h5>We published a&nbsp;hackathon prep website</h5>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://callysto-hackathon.netlify.app/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Through this site</a>&nbsp;(pictured below),&nbsp;students could learn data science basics, and assess their current data science knowledge to pick a hackathon track (Curiosity or Amal). We also published details of the challenges, and how to get support during the hackathon. Previously, all of this would have been delivered in-person.</li>
</ul>
<h5>We developed the Amal and Curiosity tracks</h5>
<ul>
<li>The tracks allowed students with different&nbsp; levels of programming skills to comfortably participate. We determined the students’ skill levels by asking them questions when they registered online.</li>
</ul>
<h5>We held an online “launch event”</h5>
<ul>
<li>The virtual launch event allowed students to connect with Callysto experts — the goal was to make students feel comfortable asking questions.</li>
</ul>
<h5>We offered students several ways to get support</h5>
<ul>
<li>Students could send questions via email, an online form, or through online tutorials.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Constructive alignment</h3>
<p>We determined the learning outcomes for the hackathon tracks</p>
<p><em>Curiosity</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn basic Python programming commands</li>
<li>Learn basic data analysis</li>
<li>Use critical and creative thinking</li>
<li>Practice spelling and grammar</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Amal</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use correct Python programming to analyze open datasets</li>
<li>Use critical thinking and creative thinking</li>
<li>Practice spelling and grammar</li>
</ul>
<h5>We designed activities within each track, to meet the learning outcomes</h5>
<p><em>Curiosity</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Learn basic Python programming commands (pictured below). The Curiosity track used artificial intelligence to support this function. Each time a student entered a wrong programming command in the step-by-step exercises, a hint and an encouraging message appeared. This gave them a built-in teaching mechanism to learn, while keeping their morale up.</li>
<li>Use critical and creative thinking. Students answered reflection questions about why they would or wouldn’t bring specific pets to Mars, based on their findings in the step-by-step exercises.</li>
<li>Learn basic data analysis. The step-by-step exercises produced many graphs. The goal was to get students comfortable with looking at data visualizations and thinking about them critically.</li>
<li>Practice spelling and grammar. Students’ use of spelling and grammar was assessed in their reflection questions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Amal</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Use correct Python programming to analyze their open dataset. Students needed to use programming commands to create data visualizations. The accuracy of their coding was then assessed.</li>
<li>Use critical and creative thinking. Students chose their own question to answer, and also sought out an open dataset to back-up their conclusion about sustaining life on Mars. They also answered a variety of reflection questions about their findings.</li>
<li>Practice spelling and grammar. Students’ use of spelling and grammar was assessed in their reflection questions.</li>
</ul>
<h5>We designed a rubric to assess the learning outcomes of challenge&nbsp;participants</h5>
<p>The rubric had four main categories:</p>
<ol>
<li>Communication</li>
<li>Use of data (this was more applicable to the Amal track)</li>
<li>Innovation and impact</li>
<li>Technical functioning (for the Curiosity track, we looked at the number of attempts to get the coding correct)</li>
</ol>
<h2><span style="color: #993366;">Create your own online hackathon</span></h2>
<p>From our experience, there are five key steps to create an online hackathon:</p>
<ul>
<li>Stage 1: Determine if a hackathon is feasible</li>
<li>Stage 2: Brainstorm with your team</li>
<li>Stage 3: Plan the hackathon</li>
<li>Stage 4: Run the hackathon</li>
<li>Stage 5: Evaluate the hackathon with your team</li>
</ul>
