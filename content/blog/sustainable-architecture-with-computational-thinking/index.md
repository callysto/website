<p>Faculty and research assistants from Athabasca University have created a series of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.oercommons.org/courseware/lesson/77325/overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">high school teaching plans</a> that teach sustainable architectural design with computational thinking.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;free and openly licensed teaching plans&nbsp;was created as part of a Callysto funded project titled Form and Function(s): A Sustainable Design meets Computational Thinking. An animation (above) was also developed to&nbsp;support the lesson plan. It shows how the evolutionary principle of Darwinâ€™s finches, math modelling, and genetic algorithms can inspire the design&nbsp;of buildings that balances costs, energy needs, and beauty.</p>
<p>The animation and lesson plans won the 2021 Canadian Network for Innovation in Education Award of Merit for the Excellence and Innovation in the Integration of Technology.</p>
<p>Athabasca will be holding a launch event for the lesson plan on June 29, 2021, from 4:30-5:30 pm, including a panel with the lesson plan and Callysto notebook creators.</p>
