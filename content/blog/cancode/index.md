<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;"><a href="http://www.cybera.ca/">Cybera</a> and the&nbsp;</span><a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" href="https://www.pims.math.ca/">Pacific Institute for Mathematical Sciences (PIMS)</a>&nbsp;are participating in the new national&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" href="https://www.canada.ca/en/innovation-science-economic-development/programs/science-technology-partnerships/cancode.html">CanCode</a>&nbsp;program. This two-year program supports initiatives that aid coding and digital skills development among Canadian youth, from grade 5-12.</p>



<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">Cybera and PIMS will trial new tools and frameworks that help teachers bring computational thinking into their math, science, social sciences, and humanities courses giving students the analytical skills needed to comprehend the digital world.</span></p>



<p><span style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;">The project, called Callysto,&nbsp;will centre around adapting the&nbsp;<a style="font-style: inherit; font-weight: inherit;" href="http://www.cybera.ca/services/jupyter-all-in-one-science-platform/">Jupyter ‘All-in-One’ Science Platform</a>&nbsp;for a younger audience in a classroom setting. Jupyter is a web-based platform that enables a broad suite of computing capabilities on any device with web browser and an internet connection. The team will develop showcase modules and host workshop training for grade 5-12 teachers to make effective use of this tool.</span></p>
