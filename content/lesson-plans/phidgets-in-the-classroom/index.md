Phidgets are a collection of hardware sensors that teachers and students can use to learn about programming with real physical devices. The phidgets in the classroom lesson plan incorporates the phidgets starter kit, which includes buttons, lights, and a temperature/humidity sensor, that students can access through a Jupyter notebook.
