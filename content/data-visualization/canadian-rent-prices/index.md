<h2>Are Canadian rent prices rising?</h2>

<p><b>Grades 10 - 12</b></p>
<p>Have you ever wondered how much renting a house in Canada costs? Is it cheaper to live in Alberta compared to British Columbia?</p>
<p>The following data visualization tracks the evolution of rental rates for various types of units (from bachelor suites to three-bedroom apartments) across different provinces and territories. The goal is to provide you with insights into Canada’s dynamic rental landscape.</p>
<h4>To answer our question we:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Collected data from&nbsp;the <a href="https://open.canada.ca/data/en/dataset/18b0c898-393f-4465-bb2a-31c922ad4d86" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Government of Canada</a> website</li>
<li>Examined rent prices by provinces or territory between the years 1987-2022</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Visualizing the data</strong></p>
<p>The bar graph below illustrates rent prices for various types of units across Canadian provinces and territories.</p>

<p>This bar graph illustrates the fluctuations in rental prices for different unit types, showcasing changes from 1987 to 2022 across each province and territory. What's evident is a nationwide, overarching upward trend in rental prices. For instance, consider Ontario, where the average cost of a two-bedroom apartment surged from $842 in 2013 to $1148 in 2022 — a 36% increase.</p>
<p>Please note that Nunavut and Yukon are not depicted in the visualization due to the absence of available data. Entries featuring a combination of two provinces (e.g., Saskatchewan/Alberta) indicate that the respective city or town straddles the borders of two different provinces.</p>
