<h2>Where are the colourful cows in Calgary?</h2>

<p><b>Grades 5 - 8</b></p>
<p>If you've ever strolled through the streets of Calgary and found yourself captivated by the sight of a large, vibrant cow statue, you're not alone. These colourful cows are the outcome of the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20010805180042/http:/udderlyart.com/about.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Udderly Art: Colourful Cows for Calgary</a> project. Initiated by a group of philanthropists in 2000, this project was established with the dual purpose of beautifying the city and raising funds for charity.</p>
<p>The group manufactured over one hundred life-size cow statues and placed them in strategic locations throughout the city, including parks, the airport, and the zoo. Donors purchased each cow for $5000, collaborating with local artists to embellish them with vibrant colours and distinctive designs. The decorated cows were exhibited from May to October of 2000 in Calgary and later auctioned off to private buyers. The project successfully raised $1.2 million dollars for charity.</p>
<p>The first twenty cows purchased were given the ‘Maverick’ denotation. We compiled a dataset of the locations of these cows by gathering information available on the project's website.</p>
<p>Using this dataset, we generated an interactive map displaying the location of each cow. You can hover over the location pins on the map to view the names of the statues, and you can also zoom in to see their precise locations.</p>
